In this playful AR game, couples are walking around OAT with hearts floating above their heads. Your job? Break those hearts with a slingshot!
- **Gameplay**: Aim at the floating hearts with a slingshot and shatter them! The more hearts you break within the time limit, the higher your score. Will you be the ultimate jodi-breaker?

### 3. **Proffenheimer (Faculty Building)**
Face off against a formidable professor boss in this academic AR battleground. Can you dodge the books he throws at you and strike back with rocks?

## Game Mechanics

### 1. **Fountain Fish Hunt AR (Library)**
- A spear appears on your screen. Tap the shot button to throw it at the fish. If the fish is there at the moment of impact, you score a point, and the fish disappears.

### 2. **Cupid's Challenge (OAT)**
- Hearts float over the couple models. Pull back the slingshot to increase its power. When you release and hit the heart, it shatters, and the couple disappears. Score as many points as possible by breaking hearts.

### 3. **Proffenheimer (Faculty Building)**
- Use a rocket launcher to tap away at the huge professor, but beware, you have limited ammo. But fret not, there are ammo boxes scattered around for you to collect. But be careful of the Professor's attacks, as it is three hits and you are out.
